# Button-Interrupt-Handling-and-7-Segment-Display-Control-Using-Shift-Registers
This project involves the development of embedded software for handling button interrupts and controlling a 7-segment display using shift registers. The system uses AVR microcontroller features such as pin change interrupts and timer interrupts to respond to button presses and update the display accordingly.
